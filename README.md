# aluminum-and-3d-printed-Framework-Case
A case for the Framework mainboard made from laser cut aluminum and 3d printed components.
Framework community post: https://community.frame.work/t/aluminum-3d-printed-main-board-enclosure/

The plate drawings are top_plate_v5.DXF and bottom_plate_v5.DXF. The plates are 1/8" 6061 aluminum (black anodized) with countersinking on the top plate (M4 holes: 0.307/0.164/82°, M3 holes: 0.236/0.13/90°).

The 3D-printed "filling" (plastic_insert_v6.STL) were printed out of black PET-G on a Prusa Mini. The power button is in its own file. I designed a small rectangular prism with the intent of holding down the chassis intrusion switch, but I have not found a good way to connect it to the top plate.

I have attached thermal pads to the inside of the top plate, which can be found here: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B096ZNHY8F/
